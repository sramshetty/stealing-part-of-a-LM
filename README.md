# Stealing Part of a Language Model
An unofficial implementation of ["Stealing Part of a Production Language Model"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634)

### Details
Attack reimplementations are for research and model safety/defense purposes alone. We don't use any proprietary API for the detailed experiments.

Llama 2 7b:
- Recover hidden dim $\pm 1$: 4095
- Predict RMSNorm as normalization layer
- Last layer reconstructed with an RMS of $2 * 10^{-5}$

### Methods
With All Logits Available:
- [x] Recovering Hidden Dimensionality
    - [x] Normalization Layer Prediction
- [x] Full Final Layer Extraction

With Top-K Logits and Logit-bias
- [x] Recover complete logit vector
    - [x] Top-K logits
    - [x] Top-K logprobs
    - [x] Cost-optimal Top-K logprobs variant  
    - [x] Top-1 Logprob
        - Have not tested logit recovery due to limited resources. 

Logprob-free
- [x] Recover complete logit vector
    - [x] Binary Search
    - [x] Hyperrectangle Relaxation Center
        - [x] With better queries
        - Bounding methods can be referenced [here](https://github.com/dpaleka/stealing-part-lm-supplementary/tree/main/optimize_logit_queries/bounders).
    - Have not tested logit recovery due to limited resources. 

### Extras
- [ ] Optimized Top-K logprobs method with linear constraint
- [ ] Shortest path formulation of logprob-free attack
